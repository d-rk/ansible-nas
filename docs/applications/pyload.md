# pyLoad

Homepage: [https://pyload.net/](https://pyload.net//)

Free and Open Source download manager written in Python and designed to be extremely lightweight, easily extensible and fully manageable via web
.
## Usage

Set `pyload_enabled: true` in your `inventories/<your_inventory>/nas.yml` file.

pyLoad's web interface can be found at http://ansible_nas_host_or_ip:8000

## Specific Configuration

### Users

Default username is `pyload` and default password is `pyload`. 

In order to add or remove users, you will need to access the container from an interactive shell (can easily be done
from portainer, if installed) and enter pyLoad's home directory `/opt/pyload` and using the command 
`python pyLoadCore.py -u` and follow the on-screen prompts. More commands to configure and customize pyLoad can be
found on its website.

### Gotify Notifications

pyload notifications can be sent using the [AppriseNotify](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) plugin.
In order to configure gotify notifications, the following steps are needed:

1. configure the variable `pyload_gotify_token` with a gotify token
1. in the pyLoad UI activate the `AppriseNotify` plugin in the config section
1. also in the config section for the `AppriseNotify` set "Configuration(s) path" to `/config/apprise.conf` (this file
   will be generated by the ansible role)
   
### Using click'n'load

click'n'load allows to import DLC containers directly via browser. The webpage therefore establishes a connection to
`127.0.0.1:9666` where the click'n'load interface is listening.

If you want to use this feature with pyLoad running on your NAS you have to forward the connection from `127.0.0.1:9666`
to `your-nas:9666`.

On linux this can be done using a ssh tunnel: 
```bash
ssh -L 127.0.0.1:9666:your-nas:9666 your-nas -N
```
